One solution to avoid unexpected results when using `calc()` with percentages and other units is to explicitly define the width of the parent element. This ensures that the percentage calculation is done correctly. Alternatively, restructure the layout to avoid relying on `calc()` for these types of calculations.  If possible, using viewport units like `vw` or `vh` can provide more consistent behavior.
