The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, when using `calc()` with percentages and other units, there can be unexpected results due to the order of operations. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not produce the expected result if the parent element's width is not known in advance. This is because the calculation is done after the percentage is resolved.
