# Unexpected `calc()` behavior with percentages in CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the CSS `calc()` function involving unexpected behavior when combining percentages and fixed units.  The issue arises from the order of operations in the calculation, leading to results that might differ from the developer's expectations.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code. The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates a possible solution. This issue is subtle and could lead to layout inconsistencies or unexpected visual differences in responsive web designs.
